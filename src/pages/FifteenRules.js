                    The Fifteen Game can be played with cards numbered one through nine, or with paper and pencil. 
                    Two players take turns claiming one card per turn, either by picking up the card or by circling the number
                    with thier color if playing with paper and pencil.

                <Typography paragraph align='justify' color='textPrimary' component='p' variant='body1' gutterBottom >
                    The first player to collect a set of three cards that add up to exactly fifteen wins. It is possible to get a total 
                    of 15 with two, four, or five cards but none of these count as a win. Going over 15 also does not win the game. 
                    If you collect extra cards you may simply ignore them when looking for sets of threee that win. If all nine cards are
                    claimed and neither player has managed to get a three-card set that adds up to 15 then the game ends in a draw.

                    It is possible to collect two cards that add up up to 15, for example 6 and 9, or 7 and 8 but these two-card 
                    combinations do not win the game. Similarly, a four card set such as 1-2-3-9, does not win the game even though
                    it adds up to 15. The three card set 6-7-8 does not win because it exceeds 15 and the goal of the game is to 
                    reach exactly 15. Examples of winning sets: 1-5-9, 2-6-7, 3-4-8. Any of these winning combinations would still count 
                    if the player had additional cards not listed.

                    The Fifteen Game is a fantastic way to help young students build fluency with foundation addition facts. 
                    Though the math required to play is simple enough to be accessible to young children, the game can still provide 
                    a challenge to most adults. Don't believe me? Try and beat my Bot!

                    The Fifteen Game only takes a few minutes to play, making it an ideal brain-break activity. 
                    You can also set up a tournament bracket and have a whole class championship fit into one day.

                    At a higher level, this game can serve as a gateway to combinatorial thinking: How many winning three-card sets are there?

                    Many problems can be solved with less work if, instead of starting from scratch, you look for similarities between the problem
                    at hand and other problems that have already been solved.
                    Two real-world problems may seem unrelated at first even though at a deeper level they are behaving according to the same
                    underlying patterns. Being familiar with mathematics makes you better at noticing when this is the case!
                    Experience this for yourself by playing the two game featured here.
                    Though the two games feel nothing alike when you first play them, the Fifteen Game is startegically identical to Tic-Tac-Toe.
                    If you have mastered Tic-Tac-Toe but still find yourself losing to my bot ath the Fifteen Game then I suggest looking into "Magic Squares".
